    mkdir pentahoReports
```

## For Developers

This project is currently only tested against the very latest and greatest bleeding edge Apache Fineract® `develop` branch on Linux Ubuntu® 24.04LTS. 
Building and using it against other Apache Fineract® versions may be possible, but is not tested or documented here.

1. Download and compile

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/openMF/mifos-reporting-plugin.git
    cd mifos-reporting-plugin && ./mvnw -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean package && cd ..
```
2. Export the Location of Mifos® reports (PRPT files) in the following variable

```bash
    export FINERACT_PENTAHO_REPORTS_PATH="$PWD/fineract-pentaho/pentahoReports/"
```    

3. Execute Apache Fineract® with the location of the Mifos® Reporting Plugin library

```bash
java -Dloader.path=$MIFOS_PENTAHO_PLUGIN_HOME/libs/ -jar $APACHE_FINERACT_HOME/fineract-provider.jar
```

4. Test the Mifos® reports execution using the following curl example or through the Mifos Web App in the Reports Menu

```bash
    curl --location --request GET 'https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/api/v1/runreports/Expected%20Payments%20By%20Date%20-%20Formatted?tenantIdentifier=default&locale=en&dateFormat=dd%20MMMM%20yyyy&R_startDate=01%20January%202022&R_endDate=02%20January%202023&R_officeId=1&output-type=PDF&R_loanOfficerId=-1' \
--header 'Fineract-Platform-TenantId: default' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic bWlmb3M6cGFzc3dvcmQ='
```

5. The output must be a PDF with the Expected Payment By Date Formated information in it (maybe it could have blank or zeroes if it is a fresh Apache Fineract® setup)

The API call (above) should not fail if you follow the steps as shown, and all conditions met for the version of Apache Fineract®

If the API call (above) [fails with](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-1173) 
_`"There is no ReportingProcessService registered in the ReportingProcessServiceProvider for this report type: Pentaho"`_, 
then this Pentaho® Plugin has not been correctly registered & loaded by Apache Fineract®.

Please note that the library will work using the latest Apache Fineract® development branch (30th December 2024), also make sure you got installed the type fonts required by the reports. This Mifos® Reporting Plugin will work only on Apache Tomcat® version 10+. 

See also [`PentahoReportsTest`](src/test/java/org/mifos/fineract/pentaho/PentahoReportsTest.java) and the [`test`](test) script.


## License

This code used to be part of the Mifos® codebase before it became [Apache Fineract®](https://fineract.apache.org).
During that move, the Pentaho® related code had to be removed, because Pentaho®'s license prevents code using it from being part of an Apache Software Foundation® hosted project.

The correct technical solution to resolve such conundrums is to use a plugin architecture - which is what this is.

Note that the code and report templates in this git repo itself are
[licensed to you under the Mozilla® Public License 2.0 (MPL)](https://github.com/openMF/mifos-reporting-plugin/blob/develop/LICENSE).
This is a separate question than the license that Pentaho® itself (i.e. the JAR/s of Pentaho®) are made available under.
